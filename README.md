🎯 Were there any requirements or goals that you were not quite able to achieve?

🎯 If so, could you please tell us what was it that you found difficult about these tasks?

- API, tried to use nasa api https://api.nasa.gov/ but couldnt figure it out :( the data that returned was 100 arrays in 1 array, and i didnt know how to navigate to every array to get an image from each array.

- I also couldnt figure out how to turn off the outline on the thumbnails when the images are active. I set the thumbnail images:active outline to none, and tried to use !important, but neither worked. I didn;t mind too much tho because it looks pretty cool.

🪐 What went really well and what could have gone better?

- mobile first approach
- javascript creating image elements and plaing them in the divs
- able to tab through thumbnails, and use left and right arrow keys
